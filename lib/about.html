    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3>Tech Background</h3>
    <p>I am a Cohort 12 student at Ada Developers Academy.  My expected graduation is scheduled for July 2020.  At that time, I will actively be seeking full time employment as a full stack software developer.</p>
    <h3>Education Background</h3>
    <p>I have nine years of teaching experience at the High School level.  I have many hours of training in teaching pedagogy and classroom management.  Along with my Oregon High School General Business teaching license, I also have two additional CTE licensures.</p>
    <h3>Early Career</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised on the southern Oregon coast in North Bend, Oregon.  In high school, I was actively involved in athletics, student leadership, and clubs.  My favorite activities were volleyball and yearbook.</p>
    <p>After graduating high school, I attended Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  At OSU, I was involved in a sorority and worked part time.  I graduated from OSU with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration Management and Education with a speciality in High School Business.</p>  
    <p>After my time in Elkton, I went back to my high school Alma Mater to teach computer technology.  At North Bend High School, I taught many technology classes in computer programming and graphic design.  I also taught other various classes like robotics and senior capstone.  During my time at NBHS, I developed their entire computer programming coursework curriculum, as well as, refactored their Senior Capstone curriculum.  I was a mentor to three other CTE teachers and was a technology contact for other teachers and staff in the building.</p>
    <p>You might ask, why did you leave education?  Well, one day in class after preaching to students for them to go for their dreams regardless of the barriers, a student asked why I never tried my hand in the technology industry.  I didnâ€™t have a very good answer and that truly got me thinking.  Why not?  After that, I applied to Ada Developers Academy and was accepted to be part of Cohort 12!</p>
    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <p>In my personal life, I am a wife and a mother.  My husband Jeff, Emily (Age 5), and Henry (Age 3) relocated to Seattle, Washington so that I could attend Ada Developers Academy.  Jeff is a Union Journeyman Carpenter and avid outdoorsman.  Both him and Henry like to go fishing and hunting.  Emily likes to be creative, dance, and play outside.  As a family, we often spend our time in Seattle checking out local events, libraries, and parks.</p>
